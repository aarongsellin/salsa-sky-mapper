# Salsa Sky Mapper

SalsaSkyMapper is a Python project for calculating the structure of the Milky Way using data from the Salsa radio telescope which is at Onsala Space Observatory.

## Introduction

This project provides a Python script for automatically calculating the positions of hydrogen clouds in our galaxy. 
It does this by utilizing two equations, one for calculating the distance between the gas cloud and the galactic center,
and another for calculating that distance to cartesian coordinates.

### Calculation f
$R = \frac{{R_0 V_0 \sin(l)}}{{V_0 \sin(l) + V_r}}$
